# Terms of Interest

## Technique

scientific technique, methodology, (could be investigation assay specification: A plan specification which indicates the assay type used to obtain data)

Def: A particular way of carrying out an experiment, procedure, or task. (proposed)

Examples: 

subclass of: assay

## Modality

Def: Those aspects of a thing that relate to its manner or state of being (distinct from its substance or identity). Alt: a method or technique used in the treatment of a specific sample. 

Examples:

subclass of: 

## Protocol

protocol, study protocol

Def: A plan specification which has sufficient level of detail and quantitative information to communicate it between investigation agents, so that different investigation agents will reliably be able to independently reproduce the process.

Examples: PCR protocol, has objective specification, amplify DNA fragment of interest, and has action specification describes the amounts of experimental reagents used (e..g. buffers, dNTPS, enzyme), and the temperature and cycle time settings for running the PCR.

subclass of: plan specification

## Study Design

study design, experimental design

Def: A plan specification comprised of protocols (which may specify how and what kinds of data will be gathered) that are executed as part of an investigation and is realized during a study design execution.

Examples: a matched pairs study design describes criteria by which subjects are identified as pairs which then undergo the same protocols, and the data generated is analyzed by comparing the differences between the paired subjects, which constitute the results of the executed study design.

subclass of: plan specification

## Plan Specification

plan specification

Def: A directive information entity with action specifications and objective specifications as parts that, when concretized, is realized in a process in which the bearer tries to achieve the objectives by taking the actions specified.

Examples: PMID: 18323827.Nat Med. 2008 Mar;14(3):226.New plan proposed to help resolve conflicting medical advice.

subclass of: directive information entity

## Assay

assay, scientific observation (IEDB alternative term: any method)

Def: A planned process with the objective to produce information about the material entity that is the evaluant, by physically examining it or its proxies.

Examples: Assay the wavelength of light emitted by excited Neon atoms. Count of geese flying over a house.

subclass of: planned process

disjoint with: data transformation, planning, information acquisition

## Planned Process

planned process

Def: A process that realizes a plan which is the concretization of a plan specification.

Examples: Injecting mice with a vaccine in order to test its efficacy.

subclass of: process
