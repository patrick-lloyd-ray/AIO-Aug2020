# Trackers

## For trackers, each ticket must have the following information:

1. status (open, accepted, closed, fixed, wontfix)
2. creator (the person who opened the ticket)
3. owner (the developer that the ticket is assigned to)
4. category, milestone, priority (used mainly for sorting)
5. discussion thread (text with information pertinent to the issue)
