# Cell Cards Application Ontology [draft]

The Cell Cards Application Ontology (CCAO) is an ontology made for supporting the Cell Cards project at the Allen Institute for Brain Science (AIBS). The CCAO integrates transcriptomic, morphological, spatial, electrophysiological, genetic information to create a multi-modal application ontology. Future expansion to transgenic, epigenetic, connectome, mapping, and origin information is tentatively planned. 

## Ontologies Leveraged [draft]

Cell Ontology (CL)

Relation Ontology [RO](https://github.com/oborel/obo-relations/)

Phenotypic Quality Ontology [PATO](https://github.com/pato-ontology/pato/)

Basic Formal Ontology [BFO](https://github.com/BFO-ontology/BFO)
