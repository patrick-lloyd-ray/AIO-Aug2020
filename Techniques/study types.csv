# name,	Definition
anatomy,	Study that aims to understand the structure of organisms or their parts.Â 
behavioral,	Study that induces and/or measures the behavior of the subject
cell counting,	Study that is designed to quantify cell populations
cell culture,	Study that employs cells isolated from the organism or tissue that are kept alive and studied in vitro
cell morphology,	Study that specifically seeks to understand the shape and structure of individual cells
cell population characterization,	Study that measures biochemical; molecular and/or physiological characteristics of populations of cells as opposed to individual cells
connectivity,	Study that maps or measures functional and/or anatomical connections between nerve cells and their targets or connections between populations of neurons in defined anatomical regions.
electrophysiology,	Study that measures electrical impulses within an organism; cell or tissue or the effects of direct electrical stimulation
epigenomics,	Study that measures modifications of genetic material that affect transcription but do not alter the organism's DNA
expression,	Study that measures or visualizes gene or protein expression within cells or tissues. Focuses on the gene.
expression characterization,	Study that charachterizes the cellular; anatomical; or morphological distribution of gene expression. Focuses on population.
genomics,	Study that measures aspects related to the complete DNA genemone of an organsim
histology,	Study that investigates the microscopic structure of tissues
microscopy,	Study that primarily uses light or electron microscopic imaging
models,	Study that creates or charachterizes computational models or simulations of other experimentally observed phenomena
morphology,	Study designed to determine the shape and structure of tissues and body parts
multimodal,	Study that employs multiple modalities in signifcant ways
optical,	Study that makes measurements using photons in the visible spectrum.
physiology,	Study that measures the function or behavior of organs and tissues in living systems.
radiology,	Study that uses at least one of a varity of minimally invasive probes such as x-rays; ultrasound; or nuclear magnetic resonance signals to capture data about the internal structure of intact subjects.
spatial transcriptomics,	Study used to spatially resolve RNA-seq data, and thereby all mRNAs; in individual tissue sections (Wikipedia).
transcriptomics,	Study that measures RNA transcription in the organism or cell population of interest
