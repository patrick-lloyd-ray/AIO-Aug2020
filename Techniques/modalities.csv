Term, parent class, SPARC def., proposed def.
anatomy, modality (assay), Study that aims to understand the structure of organisms or their parts. 
behavioral, modality (assay), Study that induces and/or measures the behavior of the subject.
expression, modality (assay), Study that measures or visualizes gene or protein expression within cells or tissues. Focuses on the gene.
genomics, modality (assay), Study that measures aspects related to the complete DNA genemone of an organsim.
cell culture, modality (assay), Study that employs cells isolated from the organism or tissue that are kept alive and studied in vitro.
histology, modality (assay), Study that investigates the microscopic structure of tissues.
morphology, modality (assay), Study designed to determine the shape and structure of tissues and body parts.
cell morphology, modality (assay), Study that specifically seeks to understand the shape and structure of individual cells. 
transcriptomics, modality (assay), Study that measures RNA transcription in the organism or cell population of interest.
electrophysiology, modality (assay), Study that measures electrical impulses within an organism, cell or tissue or the effects of direct electrical stimulation.
cell population characterization, modality (assay), Study that measures biochemical, molecular and/or physiological characteristics of populations of cells as opposed to individual cells.
radiology, modality (assay), Study that uses at least one of a varity of minimally invasive probes such as x-rays, ultrasound, or nuclear magnetic resonance signals to capture data about the internal structure of intact subjects.
microscopy, modality (assay), Study that primarily uses light or electron microscopic imaging.
physiology, modality (assay), Study that measures the function or behavior of organs and tissues in living systems.
multimodal, modality (assay), Study that employs multiple modalities in signifcant ways.
optical, modality (assay), Study that makes measurements using photons in the visible spectrum.
cell counting, modality (assay), Study that is designed to quantify cell populations.
connectivity, modality (assay), Study that maps or measures functional and/or anatomical connections between nerve cells and their targets or connections between populations of neurons in defined anatomical regions.
spatial transcriptomics, modality (assay), Study used to spatially resolve RNA-seq data, and thereby all mRNAs, in individual tissue sections (Wikipedia).
expression characterization, modality (assay), Study that charachterizes the cellular, anatomical, or morphological distribution of gene expression. Focuses on population.
epigenomics, modality (assay), Study that measures modifications of genetic material that affect transcription but do not alter the organism's DNA.
models, modality (assay), Study that creates or charachterizes computational models or simulations of other experimentally observed phenomena.
population imgaging, modality (assay),
