# Allen Institute Ontology: Fall 2020 Release

Focus: The focus of the AIO is to represent research and the results of research in a manner that is useful for scientists. It is a link between scientific knowledge gained through experimentation and the distribution/dissemination of that knowledge. The ontology development team's goal is to report areas that are in need of development in the ontology and to implement those changes in a predictable and consistent manner. The development team adheres, as much is as possible, to the standards of best practices in ontology development as outlined by the OBO Foundry (obofoundry.org). The team members are also responsible for reviewing changes in the ontology to be sure that they accurately reflect the best current understandings of brain science. The team works in conjunction with a team of software developers to ensure that the ontology and its applications are consistent and up-to-date.
